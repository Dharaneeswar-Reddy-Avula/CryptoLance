# Bidding Feature Implementation

This document describes the bidding feature that has been added to the JobDetails/ProposalDetails components, allowing users to place bids on proposals.

## Overview

The bidding feature consists of several components that work together to provide a complete bidding experience:

1. **BidForm** - Modal form for users to submit bids
2. **BidList** - Displays all bids for a proposal with edit/delete capabilities
3. **BidSection** - Main container that combines the form and list
4. **useBids** - Custom hook for managing bid operations

## Components

### BidForm

- Modal form with cover letter and bid amount fields
- Validates user wallet connection
- Submits bids to the backend API
- Handles form submission and error states

### BidList

- Displays all bids for a specific proposal
- Shows bid details: cover letter, amount, wallet address, timestamps
- Allows users to edit/delete their own bids
- Responsive design with loading and error states

### BidSection

- Main container that manages the bidding interface
- Shows/hides the bid form based on proposal state
- Only allows bidding when proposal is in "Open" state (state 1)
- Integrates with the custom useBids hook

### useBids Hook

- Manages bid state and operations
- Provides CRUD functions for bids
- Handles API calls and error management
- Maintains local state for real-time updates

## API Integration

The bidding feature integrates with the backend API at `http://localhost:3001/api/bids/`:

- **POST** `/api/bids` - Create a new bid
- **GET** `/api/bids` - Get all bids
- **GET** `/api/bids/:id` - Get a specific bid
- **PUT** `/api/bids/:id` - Update a bid
- **DELETE** `/api/bids/:id` - Delete a bid

## Proposal States

Bidding is only allowed when the proposal is in specific states:

- **State 0 (Draft)** - Not open for bidding
- **State 1 (Open)** - Open for bidding âœ…
- **State 2+ (Awarded, Funded, In Progress, etc.)** - Not open for bidding

## Usage

### In ProposalDetails Component

The BidSection is automatically included in the ProposalDetails component and appears below the ProjectTimeline when the "Details" tab is active.

### Manual Integration

To add bidding to any other component:

```jsx
import BidSection from "../Components/BidSection";

// In your component
<BidSection proposalId={proposalId} proposalState={proposalState} />;
```

## Features

### For Freelancers

- Place bids on open proposals
- Edit bid details (cover letter, amount)
- Delete bids if needed
- View all bids on a proposal

### For Clients

- View all bids on their proposals
- See bid amounts and cover letters
- Track bid timestamps and updates

### Security Features

- Wallet authentication required for all bid operations
- Users can only edit/delete their own bids
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Styling

The components use Tailwind CSS with a dark theme that matches the existing application design:

- Dark backgrounds with gray borders
- Blue accent colors for primary actions
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Loading spinners and error states
- Hover effects and transitions

## Error Handling

The system handles various error scenarios:

- Network failures
- Authentication errors
- Validation errors
- Server errors
- User permission errors

All errors are displayed to users via toast notifications and inline error messages.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the bidding feature:

1. **Bid Analytics** - Charts showing bid distribution
2. **Bid Notifications** - Email/push notifications for new bids
3. **Bid Comparison** - Side-by-side comparison of bids
4. **Bid Templates** - Pre-written cover letter templates
5. **Bid History** - Track changes to bids over time
6. **Bid Export** - Export bid data for analysis

## Testing

To test the bidding feature:

1. Ensure the backend API is running at `http://localhost:3001`
2. Connect a wallet and authenticate
3. Navigate to a proposal in "Open" state
4. Try placing a bid with valid data
5. Test editing and deleting bids
6. Verify error handling with invalid data

## Dependencies

- React 18+
- Tailwind CSS
- react-hot-toast for notifications
- Custom authentication system
- Backend API with bid endpoints
